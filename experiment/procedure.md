##### In order to perform the experiment, one needs to go through the following steps sequentially:

###### Step 1: Select Parameters for Hypothesis Testing
In this step, you define the parameters required for conducting the hypothesis test. This includes specifying the type of test (e.g., t-test, z-test, chi-square test), determining the type of hypothesis (one-tailed or two-tailed), and identifying any specific assumptions or conditions necessary for the chosen test.

###### Step 2: Enter Null and Alternative Hypotheses and Level of Significance
Here, you input the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis represents the default assumption to be tested, while the alternative hypothesis is the assertion you're investigating. Additionally, you set the level of significance (\( \alpha \)), which denotes the probability threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.

###### Step 3: Enter the Number of Samples
Specify the number of samples or observations collected for the hypothesis test. This helps determine the sample size necessary for the analysis.

###### Step 4: Enter Sample Data
Input the actual data obtained from the samples into the system. This dataset is used to conduct the hypothesis test and evaluate the null hypothesis based on the chosen test and significance level.

###### Step 5: View Graphical Representation and Hypothesis Result
Upon completing the previous steps, you can view the graphical representation of the selected sample data. This representation may include visualizations like histograms, box plots, or other relevant graphs. Additionally, you receive the result of the hypothesis test, indicating whether the null hypothesis is rejected or retained based on the entered data, hypothesis, and significance level.
