        "a": "A one-tailed hypothesis test is a hypothesis test that uses a one-sided alternative hypothesis, focusing on detecting a significant difference or relationship in one specific direction.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. A one-tailed hypothesis test uses a one-sided alternative hypothesis, not a two-sided alternative hypothesis."

      "question": "What is the power of a hypothesis test?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.",
        "b": "The probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, indicating the ability of the test to detect a significant difference or relationship when one exists.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. The power of a hypothesis test is not the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false but the probability of correctly rejecting it when it is false."

      "question": "You conduct a two-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05. The p-value is 0.03. What do you conclude?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Reject the null hypothesis.",
        "b": "Fail to reject the null hypothesis."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "When the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05 in this case), we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, you would conclude to reject the null hypothesis.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. With a p-value of 0.03 less than the significance level of 0.05, you would reject the null hypothesis."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The formula for the test statistic in a one-sample t-test is t = (sample mean - hypothesized mean) / (standard error). It measures the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean in terms of the standard error.",

        "a": "This answer is incorrect. To construct a 90% confidence interval for a population proportion, you would use the formula: sample proportion ± (critical value) * (standard error). The correct confidence interval would be 0.6 ± 1.645 * sqrt((0.6 * (1 - 0.6)) / 200), which is approximately 0.548 to 0.652.",
