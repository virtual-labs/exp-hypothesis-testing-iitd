        "b": "This statement is incorrect. While sample representativeness is important, the specific aim is to assess statistical significance.",
        "c": "The correct answer is C. The experiment aims to assess the statistical significance of a hypothesis by analyzing sample data.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The analysis of sample data aims to provide objective conclusions, not confirm preconceived notions.",
        "b": "The correct answer is B. Analyzing sample data is essential to draw accurate conclusions about the population from which the sample was taken.",
        "c": "This statement is incorrect. The aim is to analyze existing sample data, not manipulate the population.",
        "d": "This statement is incorrect. The experiment analyzes existing data; it does not aim to establish a new hypothesis."

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of drawing conclusions about the population from sample data?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To make assumptions",
        "b": "To increase sample size",
        "c": "To assess statistical significance of the hypothesis",
        "d": "To generalize findings from the sample to the entire population"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The purpose is to draw objective conclusions, not make assumptions.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Increasing sample size is a potential method but not the primary purpose.",
        "c": "This statement is incorrect. The primary purpose is not only to assess statistical significance but to draw broader conclusions.",
        "d": "The correct answer is D. Drawing conclusions about the population allows researchers to generalize findings from the sample to the entire population."

    {
      "question": "In the context of the experiment's aim, what does 'statistical significance' refer to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Confidence in the hypothesis",
        "b": "Practical importance of the results",
        "c": "Likelihood of the sample representing the population",
        "d": "Unlikelihood of the observed results occurring by chance"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. While confidence is related, statistical significance refers to a different concept.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Practical importance is not the primary focus when discussing statistical significance.",
        "c": "This statement is incorrect. While sample representativeness is essential, statistical significance specifically refers to something else.",
        "d": "The correct answer is D. 'Statistical significance' refers to the unlikelihood of the observed results occurring by chance, indicating the presence of a real effect."
