        "a": "The null hypothesis in hypothesis testing is the hypothesis that states there is no significant difference or relationship between variables.",

        "a": "A Type I error in hypothesis testing occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected, meaning that we conclude there is a significant difference or relationship when there isn't one.",

        "a": "The value that separates the rejection and non-rejection regions in a hypothesis test.",

        "a": "The critical value in hypothesis testing is the value that separates the rejection and non-rejection regions in a hypothesis test, based on the chosen significance level.",
